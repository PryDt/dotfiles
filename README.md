# pry's dotfiles
my personal dotfiles (I take a lot of inspiration from others, so feel free to use anything here!)

## current set up
 - Arch Linux (GNU/linux distro)
 - i3wm (window manager)
 - rofi (tab switcher / program runner)
 - urxvt (terminal emulator)
 - zsh (shell)
 - neovim (text editor w/ Vundle for Plugins)
