# pry's dotfiles
my personal dotfiles (I take a lot of inspiration from others, so feel free to use anything here!)

## current set up
 - Arch Linux (GNU/linux distro)
 - i3wm (window manager)
 - rofi (tab switcher / program runner)
 - Alacritty (terminal emulator)
 - zsh (shell)
 - neovim (text editor w/ Vundle for Plugins)
 - vis (vim like editor which is lighter weight)

## TODO
 - set up shell script which just links these to files on my distro
   Example: ln ./vimrc ~/.vimrc
